# E-Commerce Back End


## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a robust and scalable back-end system for an eCommerce platform. This system will manage product data, categories, and tags, which are essential for organizing and displaying products effectively in an online store.

This project was built to demonstrate the capability of Node.js, Express, and Sequelize in developing a full-featured RESTful API. It solves the problem of managing eCommerce data and its relationships, which is crucial for any online store looking to operate efficiently.

It provides a back-end solution for managing categories, products, and tags, which are fundamental components of an eCommerce system. It allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of these entities and their associations.

Through this project, I learned how to integrate Node.js with PostgreSQL using Sequelize, manage database migrations and seeds, and create a RESTful API for an eCommerce application. This project also reinforced best practices in API development and database management.
